abstract = {The cross presentation of exogenous antigen (Ag) by dendritic cells (DCs) facilitates a diversified mode of T-cell activation, orchestrates specific humoral and cellular immunity, and contributes to an efficient anti-tumor immune response. DCs-mediated cross presentation is subject to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the homing and phenotype of DCs, the spatiotemporal trafficking and degradation kinetics of Ag, and multiple microenvironmental clues, with many details largely unexplored. Here, we systemically review the current mechanistic understanding and regulation strategies of cross presentation by heterogeneous DC populations. We also provide insights into the future exploitation of DCs cross presentation for a better clinical efficacy in anti-tumor therapy.}
