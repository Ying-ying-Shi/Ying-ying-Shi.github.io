abstract = {Abstract Primarily responsible for the biogenesis and metabolism of biomolecules, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are gradually becoming the targets of therapeutic modulation, whose physiological activities and pathological manifestations determine the functional capacity and even the survival of cells. Drug delivery systems with specific physicochemical properties (passive targeting), or modified by small molecular compounds, polypeptides, and biomembranes demonstrating tropism for ER and mitochondria (active targeting) are able to reduce the nonselective accumulation of drugs, enhancing efficacy while reducing side effects. Lipid nanoparticles feature high biocompatibility, diverse cargo loading, and flexible structure modification, which are frequently used for subcellular organelle-targeted delivery of therapeutics. However, there is still a lack of systematic understanding of lipid nanoparticle-based ER and mitochondria targeting. Herein, we review the pathological significance of drug selectively delivered to the ER and mitochondria. We also summarize the molecular basis and application prospects of lipid nanoparticle-based ER and mitochondria targeting strategies, which may provide guidance for the prevention and treatment of associated diseases and disorders.
