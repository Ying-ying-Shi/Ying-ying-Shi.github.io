  In this review, recent progress in strategies of direct Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeting with specific molecules or carriers are summarized. We also discuss several advances in fields of indirect ER-targeting. This work may provide a deeper understanding over the ER biology and boost the development of precise intracellular regulation, displaying broad prospects of application.
