  We here reveal that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted abrogation of lymphocytic ER-stress transducer IRE1ɑ induces a systemic immunosuppression to alleviate skin allograft rejection, which displays synergism with immunosuppressant tacrolimus (FK506), probably due to a cooperative regulation over inflammatory transcription factors. Further exploration identified a stage-differential dependency of IRE1ɑ in the phase transition of CD8+ T cells (T-8), which might contribute centrally to the negative immunoregulation of lymphocytic IRE1ɑ inhibition.
