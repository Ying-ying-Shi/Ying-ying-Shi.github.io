  Up-regulating the cross presentation of DCs might be promising in boosting the anti-tumor immunity. The commonly used regulation strategies of DCs-based cross presentation include extending the Ag stability, optimizing the overall immune environment or DCs-stimulating factors, targeting LNs or DCs for Ag delivery, and regulating the timing and phase of immune response.
