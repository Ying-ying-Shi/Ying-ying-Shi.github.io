  We here review the molecular basis and immunological significance of unfolded protein response (UPR) involved in different stages of activated CD8+ T cells, and discuss potential regulation strategies of exploiting UPR to boost CD8+ T cell-mediated immune protection, which may provide guidance for the future development of T cell-based immunotherapy.
