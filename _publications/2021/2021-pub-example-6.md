abstract: >-
  We here reveal that the sequencing for chemotherapy and immunotherapy is closely related to the synergistic anti-tumor outcomes. Therefore, profiling the exposure kinetics of chemotherapeutic agent and αPD-1 in vivo may guide the identification of optimum administration schedule with utmost therapeutic benefits in clinical practice.
