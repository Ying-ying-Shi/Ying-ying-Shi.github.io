abstract: >-
  We here reveal that compared with professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), most somatic cells (non-APCs) prevailing in different vaccination sites demonstrate higher competence in mRNA-transfection and protein-uptake. And it’s ubiquitous for these non-APCs to activate specific immunoresponse by communicating antigenic information with nearby APCs, which is closely related to the efficacy and safety of vaccines.
