abstract: >-
  MHC-restricted T cell response plays a pivotal role in suppressing tumor growth. We here use antigenic platforms based on mRNA and protein to investigate the anti-tumor effect of dendritic cells (DCs) vaccines at tumor-bearing mice and reveal that a simultaneous and coordinated mobilization of MHC class I and II immunity by DCs potentiates cancer therapy.
