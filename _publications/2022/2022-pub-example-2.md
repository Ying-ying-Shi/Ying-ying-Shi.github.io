  Here, Vitamin E-incorporating nanoemulsions was constructed to load and deliver Cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily E member 1 (CYP2E1) inhibitor Clomethiazole (CMZ) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of hepatocytes, which mitigated hepatic oxidative stress upon ethanol exposure, reversing alcoholic liver disease (ALD).
