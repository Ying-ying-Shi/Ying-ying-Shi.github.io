  Antigen (Ag) transfer is the process of intercellular information exchange that affects immune amplification and tolerance, where antigenic component is actively transmitted from donor cell to recipient cell in the form of nucleic acid, Ag protein/peptide and peptide major histocompatibility complex (p-MHC) at specific physiological/pathological site through trogocytosis, gap junction, tunnel nanotube and extracellular vesicle.
