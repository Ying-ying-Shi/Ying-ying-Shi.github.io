  Instead of adjustments in vaccine component, we proposed a concept of chronological management of adjuvant effect to modulate the adaptive immune potency and preference inspired by natural virus infection. By simulating type I interferon expression dynamics during viral infection, three vaccine strategies employing distinct exposure sequences of adjuvant and mRNA have been developed, namely Precede, Coincide, and Follow. Follow, the strategy of adjuvant administration following mRNA, effectively suppressed tumor progression, which was attributed to enhanced mRNA translation, augmented p-MHC I expression, and elevated CD8+ T cell response. Meanwhile, Follow exhibited improved biosafety, characterized by reduced incidences of cardiac and liver toxicity, owing to its alteration to the vaccination microenvironment between successive injections. Our strategy highlights the importance of fine-tuning adjuvant effect dynamics in optimizing mRNA vaccines for clinical application.
